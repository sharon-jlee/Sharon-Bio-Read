# Sharon's Read Me

## Hello! Welcome to my Read Me file

Hi! Nice to meet you, my name is Sharon Lee and I’m an incoming college freshman at Brown University. I’m currently taking part in the Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship. In college I’m hoping to study statistics and data science and apply it into the field of media. I’m interested in how data analysis can be used to draw connections and build bridges between the various fields in society. 

Coding Languages
* Python
* C++
* Java

I hope to learn more about GitHub and all of its perks by organizing my code to be used within collaboration.
